# 0x0A. C - malloc, free

## üìö Description

This project is part of the Low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School.  
It focuses on using dynamic memory allocation in C with `malloc`, `free`, and related functions.

## üß† Learning Objectives

- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What is `malloc` and `free` and how to use them
- Why and when to use dynamic memory allocation
- How to use `valgrind` to detect memory leaks

## üìù Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Compiler: `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` are allowed from the C standard library
- Code must follow the Betty coding style

## üíª Compilation Example

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-create_array.c -o a
./a
